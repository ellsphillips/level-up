## Why is having high cohesion important?

Cohesion is a measure of how closely related the responsibilities of a component are. A component with high cohesion is focused on a single task, and low cohesion on multiple tasks.

Generally, it is helpful to maximise cohesion where possible to make components easier to maintain and reuse as they have a narrower responsibility scope.

## Loosen coupling between components

Coupling is a measure of how dependent a component is on other components. A component with high coupling is dependent on many other components, and low coupling on few other components.

Generally, it is helpful to minimise coupling where possible to make components easier to maintain and reuse as they have fewer dependencies.
